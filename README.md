# CodeAlpha_Stock-Portfolio-Tracker
I created a Stock Portfolio Tracking Tool that allows users to add, remove, and track stocks in real-time! Using the Yahoo Finance API, it fetches live stock prices and calculates profit/loss based on the purchase price.

ðŸ’¡ Features:
âœ… Add & remove stocks from the portfolio ðŸ“Š
âœ… Fetch real-time stock prices using yfinance ðŸ’²
âœ… Calculate total investment & profit/loss ðŸ“‰ðŸ“ˆ
âœ… Simple command-line interface âŒ¨

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used: Python, yfinance API, Data Handling
